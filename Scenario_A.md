Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out to discuss your preferred placement in the Advanced track for our Technical Interview Prep program.

We appreciate your enthusiasm and understand that you come from a strong academic background as a straight-A sophomore at MIT. 
However, our track placement decisions are primarily based on pre-work assessments, ensuring that participants are placed in a 
track that aligns with their technical interview skills and provides the best learning experience.

After carefully reviewing your pre-work score, we believe that the Intermediate track is better suited to your current skill 
level. We want to ensure that all participants receive an optimal experience by being in a class that is neither too advanced 
nor too basic for their proficiency.

To help you better understand the differences between the two tracks, we encourage you to review the below links. 
* [Intermediate track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip102/syllabus)
* [Advanced track](https://https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip103/syllabus)

While the initial topics may appear similar, the pacing and complexity diverge as the courses progress, making it essential 
for participants to start in the appropriate track for their skill level.


We understand that your academic achievements reflect your capabilities, and we commend your dedication. However, we want to 
emphasize that our decision is solely based on technical interview skills and ensuring that you are in an environment that 
supports your continued growth.

If you have any concerns or questions about the Intermediate track, our team is more than happy to provide additional information 
or address any specific areas where you may seek clarification.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to having you in the Intermediate track of our Technical Interview Prep program.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
