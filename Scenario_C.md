Hi Anne

Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in our Summer Interview Prep course. We appreciate your enthusiasm and dedication in seeking opportunities to enhance your skills.

I understand that you missed the deadline for the current session, and I genuinely empathize with your situation, especially considering the challenges you've faced in securing internship opportunities. We recognize the effort you've invested in applying to over 100 companies, and we want to acknowledge your commitment to your professional development.

Unfortunately, our Summer Interview Prep course is currently full with a substantial waitlist, and we are unable to accommodate additional participants for this session. I understand that this news may be disappointing, especially given your graduation this Spring, making you ineligible for next year's offering.

In situations like this, we often share our [high-level software interview guide](http://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguide), which contains valuable tips and guidelines to aid you in your interview preparation. Additionally, our resources page provides a wealth of information that might be beneficial as you continue to refine your skills and pursue future opportunities. I encourage you to explore these materials, and you're more than welcome to sign up for our mailing list to stay informed about upcoming courses or virtual events that align with your interests.

We understand the challenges you're facing, and we genuinely appreciate your understanding of the current constraints. We value your commitment to self-improvement and wish you the very best in your ongoing job search and professional journey. If you have any further questions or if there's anything else we can assist you with, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to supporting your continued growth in the future.

All the best,
Codepath.org Team
