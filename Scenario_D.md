Hi Dennis,


Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in reinstatement into the TIP101 (Intro to Technical Interview Prep) course.

I want to acknowledge your commitment to the program and your willingness to address the missed coursework. I understand that there might have been challenges leading to non-compliance with our course policy, and I appreciate your proactive approach in seeking another chance.

I would like to mention that we typically reach out to students who are at risk of withdrawal, seeking clarification on any challenges they may be facing in completing their coursework. Unfortunately, in your case, we did not receive a response to our messages via email or Slack before the withdrawal.

To better assist you, I kindly request that you provide some insights into the reasons behind the difficulties you faced in submitting the coursework. Understanding the circumstances will allow us to better assess how we can support you in this situation.

Additionally, if you could share any steps you believe would help you stay on track with the course material moving forward, it would be helpful for us to evaluate the feasibility of your request. We value the dedication of our students, and we are open to considering options that align with both your needs and the requirements of the course.

Please take some time to share your perspective on the challenges faced and any proactive measures you are willing to take to ensure successful participation in the course. Once we have a clear understanding, we can discuss potential options for reinstatement.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to your response.


All the best,
**Codepath.org Team**
