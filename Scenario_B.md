Hi Jane,

Thank you for your email and for expressing your dedication to the application process. We appreciate the time and effort you invested in creating the Flix app; your commitment to the program is commendable.

I understand that you were disappointed to learn about your ineligibility due to not being currently enrolled in a US university. I want to acknowledge your passion for learning and assure you that your efforts do not go unnoticed.

We genuinely value the enthusiasm and dedication of applicants like yourself, and it's regrettable that our current sponsorships limit our courses to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. While we are exploring opportunities to expand our reach in the future, at present, we are unable to make exceptions to the eligibility criteria.

Given our past experiences running classes in Haiti and Taiwan, we remain hopeful about the possibility of expanding to additional countries. However, as of now, we must adhere to our existing guidelines.

We want to express our sincere gratitude for your interest in CodePath and your dedication to the program. We recognize the effort you put into your application, and we genuinely regret any disappointment this decision may bring.

If you sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), weâ€™ll notify you as classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means. If there are any future developments that might allow us to reconsider applicants from outside the US, we will certainly update our community. In the meantime, we wish you continued success in your learning journey and any future endeavors.

Thank you for your understanding, Jane.

All the best,
Codepath.org Team
