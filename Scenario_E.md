Hi Jake,

Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your interest in the **Intro to Android Development** course. I understand that the application process can sometimes be a bit confusing, and I'm here to provide clarity on the next steps.

Ensure you have completed the pre-work project for [**Intro to Android Development**](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/and101/prework). The detailed instructions on how and where to submit the project can be found within the pre-work materials. If you encounter any difficulties or have specific questions, please feel free to reach out for assistance.


**Class Schedule / Time Commitment:**
Students are expected to commit **4-6 hours per week** during the **10-week program**, with the breakdown as follows:
* 2-hour synchronous class time
* 2-4 hours asynchronous work time on projects: This is flexible and can be managed based on your schedule.

If you have any additional questions or need further [**assistance**](http://www.codepath.org/preworkslack), please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to support you throughout the application process and ensure you have all the information needed for a successful experience in the program.

Thank you for your dedication to the application, and I look forward to seeing you in the Intro to Android Development course.

All the best,
